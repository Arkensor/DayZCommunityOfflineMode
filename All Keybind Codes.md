# Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad Key Codes
| Input | Description | 
| ----- | ----- |
| Keyboard | All keyboard keys begin with k letter, ie.: kA mean A keyxA |
| Gamepad | All gamepad elements begin with x letter, ie.: xA mean A button. We do use Xbox360 naming convention since it was implemented first, but all codes will work well. Some 3rd party vendors console-compatible gamepads, event with differently marked buttons, should work as well. xLJoyAngle/ xRJoyAngle - works within 0Â° .. 360Â° where 0Â° is forward direction. xLJoyStrength/ xRJoyStrength - works withing 0.0 .. 1.0 where 0.0 is center and 1.0 is fares position from center in any direction. |
| Mouse | All mice buttons begin with m letter, ie.: mBLeft mean Left Button Mouse. Horizontal and Vertical movements can be read directly from controller (does not have key code) |
